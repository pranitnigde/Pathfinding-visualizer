## What is Pathfinding Algorithm?

Pathfinding algorithms are usually an attempt to solve the shortest path problem in graph theory. They try to find the best path given a starting point and ending point based on some predefined criteria.

Before visualization choose an algorithm for finding the shortest path. Not all alogorithms guarantee the shortest path.
Adding walls

Click on the grid to add a wall. Generate mazes and patterns from the "Mazes & Patterns" drop-down menu.
Adding flag

Click the "Add Flag" button. Adding a flag will change the course of the chosen algorithm. In other words, the algorithm will first look for the flag and will then look for the target node. Note that the A Star Algorithm and Greedy Best First Algorithm does not support adding a flag.
Visualize

Click on the Virtualize Button to virtualize the algorithm and find the shortest path in the course
Clear Board & Clear Path

You can clear the current path, clear walls, clear the entire board all from the navbar. Clear board will clear all the walls and path. Clear path will clear the visualized path.
